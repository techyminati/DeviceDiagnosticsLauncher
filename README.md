# Device Diagnostics Launcher

**Device Diagnostics Launcher** is a simple Android application designed to provide easy access to the hidden Device Diagnostics menu on Android 15. This diagnostics tool allows users to test and check their phone's hardware components, as well as view essential information such as battery and storage health.

## üìñ Why Device Diagnostics Launcher Was Created

In the Android 15 stable release, Google decided to hide the Device Diagnostics menu. Although the diagnostics app is still present on the device, it cannot be launched directly from the system UI. According to Google, the feature was removed because most Pixel devices were not able to report accurate data reliably.

However, during testing, many users found that the diagnostics app still provided accurate information for key metrics such as:

- Display and touchscreen responsiveness
- Battery health and status
- Storage usage and health

This app was developed to "bridge the gap" by giving users the ability to access this hidden feature, allowing them to continue using the diagnostics tool to get accurate information about their device's health.

## üöÄ Features

- **Instant Launch**: Automatically opens the hidden Device Diagnostics menu without any additional steps.
- **Quick Access**: Eliminates the need for complex ADB commands or rooting to access diagnostic features.
- **Battery & Storage Info**: View essential battery and storage health details that might not be available through regular system menus.
- **Simple & Lightweight**: Focuses on functionality, with no unnecessary UI components.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Please note that the Device Diagnostics menu was hidden by Google in the stable release of Android 15. While this app can provide access to the tool, Google might disable or restrict its functionality in future updates. Use this app at your own discretion.
